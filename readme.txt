Missing Functionality
- Options menu w/ audio controls & control rebinding: Was fairly low-priority for me, and I didn't have the time to fully implement it, so it was scrapped. This means controls are not rebindable (hope WAD+Shift isn't too awkward for you), and audio cannot be changed in game (you'll have to use Windows' built-in Volume Mixer for that)
- Track selection menu does not show personal bests: Low priorty thing that I didn't end up doing

Unplanned Functionality
- This wasn't necessarily "unplanned," more "I didn't consider the possibility but I guess it's here now," but both the soundtrack and levels are technically "moddable." This means you can add your own music and add your own tracks if you so desire.

Bugs & Other Issues
- Collisions may not perform as expected under certain conditions (such as high player speeds & lag). This can happen when the player goes through a given block and intersects another block that theoretically should not be collided with. The best way to fix this would be to increase the game's update speed, but that creates enough issues that I decided to prioritize it below everything else (which is why it never got fixed)
- The game MAY stutter and freeze more than expected. I experienced this issue quite a bit while developing this game, but other people who have downloaded the game (i.e. Daniel Su) have said that they don't experience the same lag. Because of this, I have no good way of fixing it.

Notes
- Most of the menu designs were changed from the concepts, though functionality is otherwise the same (except where explicitly mentioned)
- I did my best to keep the game flowing if there are invalid things (e.g. wrong file format for blocks and tracks, invalid music format, etc.) but there is still a noteworthy chance of seeing an exception in the console. For the most part, these won't break the flow of the game, but something is bound to slip through the cracks.
